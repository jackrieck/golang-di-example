# golang-di-example

A simple golang application to demonstrate dependency injection for unit testing. Read the associated blog post [here](http://my-site.com)

## Notes

* to run tests `go test ./...`
* Always check in `vendor/`, this protects your repository from disappearing dependencies and makes building easier.
* Repository layout is based off of [golang-project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)
